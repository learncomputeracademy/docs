      <h2>Brochure Design</h2>
      <hr>
      <h2>What is a Brochure?</h2>
      <p>The brochure is one among the simplest ways to present your company. There are tri-fold brochures wont to advertise a replacement product or service that your company offers, or there are bi-fold folders that are wont to present your company projects outside or inside it. There are different brochure types, and each type features a different thanks to be designed. The criterion adopted to style a bi-fold brochure to present your company projects for internal use would vary from the one for external use.</p>
      <p>A well-designed brochure is that the best thanks to introduce your company to your potential customers.</p>
      <p>A brochure has three functions:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Informative function: a brochure is typically wont to inform your potential customers with regards to your company. This information is said to your company presentation, a replacement product or service that your company offers, or a recent change in your name , etc.</li>
       <li>Advertising function: a brochure is basically important as an advertising tool, which attractively allows you to market one or more products or services. For further details, this function are going to be analyzed within the section called Advertising aspect.</li>
       <li>Identification function: a well-done brochure design allows you to take care of an equivalent criterion through all of your company brochures. If this criterion (sometimes called concept) is unified altogether the brochure types, it'll make your company to be recognized automatically. it'll give your company prestige and credibility. it's important for your company brochure not only have a “concept” but also to possess a logo: a well-designed logo is important for any company, is one among the primary steps to start out an ad campaign .</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These three functions should interact . The brochure should be the results of that interaction, otherwise, it won’t be effective. Maybe one among those stands out quite the others, but this shouldn’t affect your brochure design. for instance , if your company launches a replacement product and decides to possess a brochure designed for this launch, the function which will stand out on your brochure would be the advertising one, albeit this brochure could have information regarding the merchandise and at an equivalent time represent your company.</p>
      <p>But if your company presents a project to a different company’s executives, the function that might appear at the primary sight during this brochure is that the identification one, which makes your company to be seen secure and prestigious, while the advertising and therefore the informative functions would be during a second place.</p>
      <p>The brochure is extremely important once we mention your corporate image. you've got to debate together with your design company what would be the simplest brochure format to settle on since that choice is decisive if you would like your company to be identified in an efficient way. An advertising brochure might be colourful and have big typography, but those characteristics aren’t the proper ones for a project presentation since that project could have an easy , austere and formal brochure design. Morphologically it’s not an equivalent presenting a project with a tri-fold brochure than with folder with inserts. Maybe both options ate right, but you've got to make a decision which one are going to be more convenient and if it'll maximize your benefits.</p>
      <p>You could determine more about this morphological aspect within the section called brochure types, where we’ll be showing you different brochure formats.</p>
      <p>In a few words, to plan your company brochure you have to:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Think about your brochure objective and function.</li>
       <li>Stand out one of its functions, like informative, advertising or identification functions.</li>
       <li>Check if those functions are in the brochure, even though one stands out and the others don’t.</li>
       <li>Choose the right brochure format based on its objective.</li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      <p>Popular uses for brochures include company brochures, sales brochures, spec sheets, event brochures, menus, and mailers. But what fold would go best for each use? Keep reading.</p>
      <p>There aren’t a lot of resources out there about brochure printing so people remain uncertain. To most people, a brochure is just a brochure. All the different types balled up into one category. They send designs for printing not knowing that there are folds more suited for certain tasks than others.</p>
      <p>Before we begin, you need to understand what each fold looks like. This will help you visually distinguish one fold from the other. Below are all the popular brochure folds commonly offered by printing companies.</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Trifold</li>
       <li>Half-Fold</li>
       <li>Z-Fold</li>
       <li>Gate Fold</li>
       <li>French Fold</li>

      <h2>Brochure Uses</h2>
      <p>Depending on the goal, entrepreneurs create various types of brochures to grow their business. Keep in mind that this is just a guide to get you started. Ultimately, you get to decide what fold to use for your project.</p>

      <h2>01. Company Brochures</h2>
      <span>
       <b>Suggestion: Trifold, Gate Fold, Double Gate Fold</b>
      </span>
      <p>Company brochures are nothing new and are a staple in many offices across the globe. They are reserved for guests wanting more information about the company. The brochure acknowledges the company’s history while highlighting where it is today and what it has accomplished since.</p>
      <div class="img-block" style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1rem;">
       <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../assets/img/graphics-design/brochure/company-brochures.jpg" alt="Brochure" class="img-thumbnail">
       <span style="display:block;">
        <i>Company Brochure</i>
       </span>
      </div>
      <p>A trifold brochure is your safest bet. They are small enough to store but big enough to contain many text and images. I do, however, recommend using gate fold or double gate fold. Since both front panels are situated next to each other, you can use both of them to show one big, striking image that best represents your company.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>02. Sales Brochures</h2>
      <span>
       <b>Suggestion: Z-Fold, Double Parallel Fold, Roll Fold</b>
      </span>
      <p>These are commonly known as promotional or advertising brochures and are used to present clients with products and services offered. These are point-of-sale materials that aid in providing product information.</p>
      <p>Since these are commonly placed on countertops or in racks beside the counter, you want something that can be easily stacked and not take up too much room. I’d suggest that you use a z-fold, double parallel fold, or roll fold.</p>
      <div class="img-block" style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1rem;">
       <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../assets/img/graphics-design/brochure/sales-brochure.jpg" alt="Brochure" class="img-thumbnail">
       <span style="display:block;">
        <i>Sales Brochure</i>
       </span>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <h2>Spec Sheets</h2>
      <span>
       <b>Suggestion: No Fold, Half-Fold </b>
      </span>
      <p>Spec sheets are important because they are there to support the sales team. They are there to act as a point of reference when customers need to understand the product better.</p>
      <p>Spec sheets makes life easier for salespeople. It allows them to hand over all the technical information they need to disclose in one move so they can entertain their customers’ other concerns. No fuss, no more canned responses needed.</p>
      <p>I find no fold brochures or half-fold brochures work best as spec sheets.</p>
      <div class="img-block" style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1rem;">
       <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/../assets/img/graphics-design/brochure/spec-brochure.jpg" alt="Brochure" class="img-thumbnail">
       <span style="display:block;">
        <i>Specification Brochure</i>
       </span>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <h2>Event Brochures</h2>
      <span>
       <b>Suggestion: No Fold, Z-Fold</b>
      </span>
      <p>If you have an event coming up that you’d like to promote, you can use event brochures to promote it. Usually a no fold brochure is sufficient. But for fundraisers, fun runs, charity golf tournaments, or other events where there is a lot of information you’d like to include, a z-fold gives your brochures a classy look.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Menus</h2>
      <span>
       <b>Suggestion: No Fold, Trifold</b>
      </span>
      <p>Yes, you can print brochures to be used as menus. And because brochures are affordable, you can give these away to customers and simply reorder when you’re running low. You can print no fold brochures if you’re planning on using them in your restaurant. Choose trifold if your menus are meant to be used as takeouts.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Mailers</h2>
      <span>
       <b>Suggestion: Have Fun With It</b>
      </span>
      <p>Brochure mailers are a bridge between you and your customer. This can be tough, especially because the people who will be receiving your materials have probably never heard of you or your brand. That’s why you should choose a fold that would best represent your brand.</p>
      <p>Try choosing a fold that would really set you apart from the competition. Something like a double parallel fold, french fold, or accordion fold would be nice.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Brochure sizes</h2>
      <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
       <thead class="thead-shades">
