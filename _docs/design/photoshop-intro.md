      <h1>Photoshop</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Photoshop is Adobe's photo editing, image creation and graphic design software.</p>
      <p>The software provides many image editing features for <a href="..{{ site.baseurl }}/raster-graphics" target="_blank">raster</a> ( <a href="..{{ site.baseurl }}/pixel" target="_blank">pixel</a>-based) <a href="..{{ site.baseurl }}/image" target="_blank">images</a> as well as <a href="..{{ site.baseurl }}/vector-graphics" target="_blank">vector graphics</a>. It uses a layer-based editing system that enables image creation and altering with multiple overlays that support transparency. Layers can also act as masks or filters, altering underlying colors. Shadows and other effects can be added to the layers. Photoshop actions include automation features to reduce the need for repetitive tasks. An option known as Photoshop CC (Creative Cloud) allows users to work on content from any computer. </p>
      <p>Photoshop been the industry standard image manipulation program for so long that its name has become a verb: It is common parlance to say that an image has been “photoshopped” or even just “shopped." Shopped, in this context, is synonymous with edited, manipulated or faked -- often regardless of the software actually used.</p>

      <p>Setting up your document correctly from the start will make your job much easier as you work through your project. This will require some advanced planning. For example, if your inal output will be a brochure, you may need to set up your document to be horizontal and double-sided.</p>

        <h4>Layers</h4>
        <p>Layers let you organize your work into distinct levels that can be edited and viewed as individual units. Every Photoshop CC 2015 document contains at least one layer. Creating multiple layers lets you easily control how your artwork is printed, displayed, and edited. You will use the Layers palette often while creating a document, so it is crucial to understand what it does and how to use it.</p>
